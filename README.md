This simply means that your current computer setup will not run powershell scripts.  You can adjust these settings in order to run this script, then once complete you can return them to their previous state.  

### Step 1 - Open Powershell as Administrator
Click on your start menu, type powershell, then click Run as administrator

### Step 4 - Run the compatibility script again
You can now navigate to the original Powershell script in Windows Explorer, right click and select "Run with Powershell". 

### Step 5 - Return your settings back to default
Return back to your Administrator Powershell window and type ```Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Undefined```.  Replace Undefined with the value you had recorded in step 3 if different.
